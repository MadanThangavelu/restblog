Downloading

Installing
----------

Currently, the package is self-contained in a very straightforward fashion. It
is not packaged in any form suitable for either ``easy_install`` or ``pip``.
Although, that's the next highest priority feature to get done.

For the time being, all you have to do is get the package, unpack it and make
sure the ``restblog`` binary in you path and the directory for the Python
packages is somehow in your ``sys.path`` via ``PYTHONPATH`` or alternate
mechanisms.

For example::

    tar xvzf restblog-1.2.0.tar.gz
    cd restblog

Unix, C-Shell::

    source setupenviron.csh

After that, you should be able to use ``restblog``. You can test by doing::

    restblog

or::

    restblog --help
